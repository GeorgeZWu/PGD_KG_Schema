# PGD_KG_Schema
A knowledge graph model of performance-based generative design of sustainable buildings
# 1. Overview
This is the official repository of the knowledge graph model of performance-based generative design of sustainable buildings (PGD-KG Schema).  
The models are OWL files in Turtle syntax. You can view and edit them in OWL-supported tools such as Protégé.  
`schema_only_PGD_KG_model.owl` is the PGD-KG model with fundamental classes and properties. You can reuse the classes and properties to build your own models.  
`case1068_PGD_KG_model.owl` and `case6725_PGD_KG_model.owl` are two example models with enriched individuals in a design project.
